# Aave V4 Deployment Infrastructure

Infrastructure for deploying and configuring Aave V4.

## Quickstart

Deploys all contracts and grants basic roles. No assets are listed, no spokes are registered, no reserves are configured.

### 1. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.example` and set:

| Variable  | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `account` | Foundry keystore account name for the deployer       |
| `dry`     | Leave blank to broadcast; set to a value to simulate |
| `chain`   | String describing the chain, e.g. "mainnet"          |

The deploy script constructs a `FullDeployInputs` struct (see `src/deployments/utils/libraries/InputUtils.sol`) with admin addresses, hub/spoke labels, CREATE2 salt, and gateway flags. Override `_getDeployInputs()` in your chain-specific script (extends `AaveV4DeployBatchBase.s.sol`) to provide these values. Any zero-address admin fields default to the deployer.

### 2. Pre-deploy LiquidationLogic (required for spokes)

```bash
make deploy-precompile
```

This deploys `LiquidationLogic` via CREATE2 and writes `FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES` to `.env` so Foundry can link `SpokeInstance` bytecode on the next compilation. See [LiquidationLogic Pre-deployment](#liquidationlogic-pre-deployment) for details.

### 3. Deploy Remaining Contracts

```bash
make deploy-contracts
```

This runs `AaveV4DeployOrchestration.deployAaveV4()`, which deploys batches in order: AccessManager → role labeling → Configurators → Configurator role setup → TreasurySpoke → Hubs → Spokes → Gateways → PositionManagers → role grants → DEFAULT_ADMIN transfer.

### TokenizationSpoke

`TokenizationSpoke` is **not** deployed by the orchestration, because it requires an asset to already be listed on a Hub and Spoke. Each `TokenizationSpoke` instance should be deployed separately after asset listing, one per asset.

### LiquidationLogic Pre-deployment

`LiquidationLogic` is an external Solidity library used by `Spoke.sol` (via `SpokeInstance`). Because it has `external` functions, the compiler emits it as a separate contract that `SpokeInstance` calls via `DELEGATECALL` at runtime. When Solidity compiles `SpokeInstance`, it leaves placeholder references (`__$<hash>$__`) in the bytecode where the library address should go. You cannot deploy `SpokeInstance` until those placeholders are replaced with a real on-chain address.

This requires a **two-step deploy** because Foundry needs to re-compile with the library address baked into the bytecode:

**Step 1 — `LibraryPreCompile.s.sol`** (separate transaction):

1. `SpokeDeployUtils.deployLiquidationLogic()` deploys it via CREATE2 with `salt=0`
2. Writes `FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES=src/spoke/libraries/LiquidationLogic.sol:LiquidationLogic:0x<address>` to `.env` via FFI
3. On re-run: if the library is already deployed (has code), skips. If `FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES` exists but the library isn't deployed (wrong chain/fork), deletes the stale entry and asks you to run again

**Step 2 — Main deploy script** (next invocation):

1. Foundry reads `.env` at startup, sees `FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES`, and at compile time replaces all `__$<hash>$__` placeholders in `SpokeInstance`'s bytecode with the library address
2. `AaveV4SpokeInstanceBatch` deploys `SpokeInstance` with fully linked bytecode

### Labels and Deterministic Deployment

Hub and spoke labels (provided via `FullDeployInputs.hubLabels` / `spokeLabels`) drive deterministic addressing and identify instances in deployment reports.

**Salt derivation** — Deployed addresses are deterministic, derived from three inputs: the deployer address, the user-provided salt, and the instance label. First, `_deriveSalt` combines the deployer address and user salt into a root salt. Then, for each hub or spoke, `_deriveChildSalt` hashes the root salt with the contract type (`"hub"` or `"spoke"`) and the label to produce a unique child salt. This child salt is passed to `Create2Utils.create2Deploy()`. Because the deployer address is embedded in the root salt, different deployers produce valid, unique deployed contract addresses even with identical labels and user salt.

**Duplicate label protection** — Before deploying any hubs or spokes, the orchestration validates unique labels for each array. Duplicate hub labels or duplicate spoke labels will revert. Hub and spoke labels are validated independently. A hub and a spoke can share the same label since they use different `contractType` strings in salt derivation.

**CREATE2 collision protection** — `Create2Utils.create2Deploy()` computes the deterministic address from the salt and bytecode before deploying. If a contract already exists at that address (e.g. same salt and bytecode were used in a previous deployment), it reverts with `ContractAlreadyDeployed()`. This prevents silent no-ops or collisions when re-running a deploy script.

### Roles (`Roles.sol`)

Roles are namespaced by contract domain: Hub (100-199), HubConfigurator (200-299), Spoke (300-399), SpokeConfigurator (400-499).

For configurators, initially a single Domain Admin role (HUB_CONFIGURATOR_DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROLE = 200, SPOKE_CONFIGURATOR_DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROLE = 400) holds all target selectors. As more granular roles are introduced, they should be added at the next available ID (201, 202, ... / 401, 402, ...) and the corresponding selectors reassigned from the Domain Admin role to the new granular role:

- Existing role IDs should never be overwritten or reused for a different purpose.
- New roles are always appended with an incremented ID.
- The Domain Admin role (200/400) only ever has its selector set shrink over time as selectors are divided into more granular roles.
- Addresses holding the Domain Admin role should be granted the new granular role being added to retain their existing access.

See `Roles.sol` NatSpec for the full role strategy and evolution guidelines. All roles are labeled on the `AccessManagerEnumerable` during deployment via `AaveV4AccessManagerRolesProcedure.labelAllRoles()`. Each role is labeled with its `Roles.sol` constant name (e.g., role 101 is labeled `"HUB_CONFIGURATOR_ROLE"`). Labels are queryable on-chain via `getLabelOfRole()` and `getRoleOfLabel()`.
